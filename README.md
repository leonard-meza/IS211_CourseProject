Flask Blog Application

This blog application is using python, flask and SQLite. 
Featuring user registration and login, allowing multiple different authors to manage posts.

Each post belongs to a category, and users can create, edit, delete, publish, or unpublish entries with the dashboard.

The public page is a simple home page listing all published posts including category and permalink to the corresponding post.
The directory structure includes app.py, a database schema and an html templates directory with html and jinja2 html templates, as well as a static directory with basic css styling located in style.css.

The project was tested to run with the command [python app.py].
Navigating to [http://127.0.0.1:5000] in your browser after running [python app.py] will allow the exploration of the blog, the ability to register new users, and manage posts with the dashboard.
